					<h2>Challenges and tips</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>
						1. Data
					</h3>
				</section>
				<section>
					If you <i><b>assume</b></i> you have the data.<br> Go and <i><b>make sure</i></b> you have it.
				</section>
				<section>
					Particularly if you need it outside of your<br> departments secure environment.
				</section>
				<section>
					Make sure you've accounted for things like data security.
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>
						2. Coding experience
					</h3>
				</section>
				<section>
					When I started I thought I was good enough.<br> But I still learned a lot.
				</section>
				<section>
					I had to learn packages and libraries I wasn't familiar with in my normal data
					wrangling focused job.
				</section>
				<section>
					For all those who haven't done much coding before...<br><br>
					<span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold">There is no silver bullet :( </span>
				</section>
				<section>
					In my experience learning by doing works well.
				</section>
				<section>
					But that is why you have mentors.<br>
					<span class='fragment fade-in'>And this is what you're here to upskill in.</span>
				</section>
				<section>
					However, they are there to support, not to do your work for you!
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>
						3. Tedium of data massaging
					</h3>
				</section>
				<section>
					Don't know how about You, but I' don't enjoy this part of data.'
				</section>
				<section>
					Yet my DSA cohort seemed to agree that they spent 80% on data wrangling and 20% doing data science!
				</section>
				<section>
					The better you prepare your data beforehand the easier it is going to be to achieve your final goal.
				</section>
				<section>
					However learning to wrangle data is in itself useful.
				</section>
				<section>
					The better you know it, the faster you'll do it next time.
				</section>

					<h2>Lets pause here for a second...</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>...and talk about the number</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h1 style="text-align:center">12</h1>
					<p class="fragment fade-in" style="text-align:center">Any ideas why I'm bringing this up?<p>
					<p class="fragment fade-in" style="text-align:center">12 is the number of working days you have<p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Ultimately it all boils down to time</p>

					<h3>4. Minimum Viable Product </h3>
				</section>
				<section>
					I've borrowed the titular term from Agile project management.<br><br>
					At least thats where I've heard it.
				</section>
				<section>
					Because of the <u><b>time</b></u> issue I talked about you will be under time pressure
					to learn any coding, stats, maths and anything else you might need in a very short period of time.
				</section>
				<section>
					If you have a particularly ambitious project. You have to realise this trade off.
					<br><br>
					And then decide what the skeleton version or the minimum viable version of your project looks like.
