					<h2>WHO AM I?</h2></section>
					<aside class="notes">
						So who am I? <br><br>
					</aside>
				<section>
					<p>BSc Economics</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						I did an Economics degree here in the UK. <br>
						So I haven't really been that much involved in DS <br>
						Modeling and the maths focused more on economic practicalities <br>
						Meaning I had to start from the bottom and now I'm here.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Did my sandwich year after my 3rd year</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						I was an odd case when it came to placements as I did my sandwich year on top of my degree.<br><br>
						Making it less of a traditional sandwich.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3><u>September 2015:</u><br> AO Sandwich student</h3></section>
					<aside class="notes">
						My first job in the civil services was this placement. <br><br>
						ONS was one of my choices when I applied to GES and I got placed in the prices divison
					</aside>
				<section>
					<p>Learned python and did <u>tons</u> of work with python</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						I will say I did tons of python quite a bit here, but really it was a normal amount that an analyst can expect to do. <br><br>
						Mind you the learning took me ages as python in the ONS was fairly a new idea, but it was gaining momentum. <br><br>
						We didn't have infrastructure and I had to learn quite a bit at home, but that was my own personal goals not something ONS insisted on me doing. <br><br>
						People were concerned I did python at home at the expense of my wellbeing whereas I actually really liked it.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3><u>Spring 2016:</u><br>HEO Economist</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						So midway through my placement I applied and got an HEO job. <br><br>
						That said, I sort of tried to keep as much python work involvement as I could even as an economist.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Kept doing tons of python work</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						By this point I've started to look like the python guru of the branch/division although I was way off <br><br>
						I also insisted that we start enticing people to upskill themselves in the division with regards to programming <br><br>
						And started providing introductions to python / circulating resources and fostering interest
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3><u>Summer 2017:</u><br>Accelerator</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						I will talk about my project a little bit in future slides, but suffice to say I had a ton of fun on the DSA.

					<p>Still doing tons of python work . . .</p>

					<h3><u>December 2017:</u><br>HEO Data Scientist</h3></section>
					<aside class="notes">
						Most of what I learned to get it was from DSA. <br><br>
						And I am pretty sure I couldn't have gotten this job without it. <br><br>
						However, I will save you some of the retrospective embarassment I felt when remembering my answers in the interview by providing with an incredible resource (particularly to those using python)
					</aside>
				<section>
					<p>Learned a lot of softer skills</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Things like how to get things done.<br><br>
						Speak their language and understand their concerns <br><br>
						Although technical skills are important, building working relationships (particularly with tech people) is also crucial. <br><br>
						I had a list of fixers <br><br>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>. . . but still did a lot of python coding<br>(but now distributed).</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						I had to work with a different python beast called pyspark. <br><br>
						Won't go into detail but think - how do you make multiple smaller computers do the heavy lifting one large computer does. <br><br>
						If anyone's interested in this come round I'll give you more info.

					<h2>CHALLENGES AND TIPS</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						Now this is the meat and potatoes so to speak of what I really want to highlight to you. <br><br>
						By limiting the challenges and following the tips you most likely will have a better shot of getting more out of the DSA.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>
						1. Data
					</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						Lets talk about data.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					If you <i><b>assume</b></i> you have the data.<br> Go and <i><b>make sure</i></b> you have it.
				</section>
				<section>
					Particularly if you need it outside of your<br> departments secure environment.
					<aside class="notes">
						Think: when I come in on my first Thursday, will I be able to open this CSV/json/excel file and jump right into work
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					Make sure you've accounted for things like data security.
					<aside class="notes">
						And data Ethics. Sure, the technology is there to webscrape but how will that be perceived. <br><br>
						Perhaps I am overly cautious here. But as a civil service data scientist you need to think about these things
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>
						2. Coding experience
					</h3>
				</section>
				<section>
					When I started I thought I was good enough.<br>
					But I still learned a lot.
					<aside class="notes">
						By good enough I mean, I had confidence that I won't learn much on the coding side.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					I had to learn packages and libraries I wasn't familiar with in my normal data
					wrangling focused job.
				</section>
				<section>
					For all those who haven't done much coding before...<br><br>
					<span style="color:#FF4081;font-weight:bold">There is no silver bullet :( </span>
					<aside class="notes">
						Similarly to the any normal language, you will not able able to speak it without practice. <br><br>
						I started by learning the alphabet and grammar, and I am still learning how to write poetry.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					In my experience learning by doing works well.
					<aside class="notes">
						Who here loves puzzles? Games, jigsaw, sudoku anything? <br><br>
						Well basically all those "UGH can't find the solution" and "YES I DID IT. IT WORKS" moments are very pertinent to programming
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					Thats why you have mentors. A luxury I didn't have in my sandwich student days!<br>
					<span class='fragment fade-in'>So use them!</span>
				</section>
				<section>
					However, they are there to support, not to do your work for you!
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>
						3. Tedium of data massaging
					</h3>
				</section>
				<section>
					Don't know how about You, but I' don't enjoy this part of data.'
					<aside class="notes">
						In my head, the world of data science was always more about drawing insight from data using computer science and maths. <br><br>
						Granular and headache inducing preprocessing of was never something I aspired to.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					Yet my DSA cohort seemed to agree that they spent 80% on data wrangling and 20% doing all the 'fun stuff'!
				</section>
				<section>
					The better you prepare your data beforehand the easier it is going to be to achieve your final goal.
				</section>
				<section>
					However learning to wrangle data is in itself useful.
					<aside class="notes">
						I doubt that any of you will have a perfect dataset. And ultimately the 80% of work is most likely what you will use more in your daily job. <br>
						And this is not bad, because ... (next slide)
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					The better you know it, the faster you'll do it next time.
				</section>
			</section>
			<section>
				<section>
					<h2>Lets pause here for a second...</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						Look at watch for one second
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>...and talk about the number</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h1 style="text-align:center">12</h1>
					<p class="fragment fade-in" style="text-align:center">Any ideas why I'm bringing this up?<p>
					<p class="fragment fade-in" style="text-align:center">12 is the number of working days you have<p>
					<aside class="notes">
						I mean I would be suprised if anyone can spot how 12 relates to the DSA.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Ultimately it all boils down to time</p>
				</section>
				<section data-background-image="images/deadline.gif"></section>

					<aside class="notes">
						I don't think anyone needs a reminder here about the concept of time and quality trade off. <br><br>
						But ultimately I don't think anyone expects a 10 minute Spider-man out of you given time constraints. <br><br>
						So your goal is to get a 1 minute spider-man that you can always improve.
					</aside>

				<section>
					<h3>4. Focus on getting A to B </h3>
				</section>
				<section>
					Keeping your eyes on the prize and not getting too distracted is hard.<br><br>
					Focus on getting a <b><u>working pipeline</u></b> going first and record any areas to improve upon as you go.
					<aside class="notes">
						I am not saying this to stop ambition. But with my limited experience, in the DSA I wanted to do a lot of things and got sidetracked to other fun features quite easily.<br>
						That second point is spot on what I would recommend. If you can come back to your business area saying: 'My pipeline can't handle JSON files yet, but heres how it processes CSVs to completion' <br>
						You can get much more buy in.
				</section>
				<section>
					Because of the <u><b>time</b></u> issue you will be under time pressure
					to learn any coding, stats, maths and anything else you might need in a very short period of time.
				</section>
				<section>
					If you have a particularly ambitious project. You have to realise this trade off.
					<br><br>
					And then decide what the skeleton version of your project looks like.
				</section>
				<section data-background-image="images/giphy.gif">
				<aside class="notes">
					Which is what I thank my mentors for. As they did this on our first ever catch up. Sort of crushed my ambitions a little. <br><br>
					But ultimately this meant I got to learn more and also deliver my skeleton that we could build upon later.

						<h3>If you have a proof of concept that

					<h2>WHAT I LEARNED</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					Well, like I said I had 0 experience in ML going in.<br><br>
					And my perception was that in practice doing ML was rocket science 🚀
				</section>
				<section style="text-align:center">
					<img src="images/pypiprojects.png">
					<img src="images/stack-overflow.png">
					<aside class="notes">
						But in reality it often is the case with open source software that whatever you are trying to do is already been done!<br><br>
						And if some of you have done coding it is common practice to reuse others code and use other peoples packages.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					Now the same goes for Machine Learning/Web App making/Data Wrangling packages. <br>
				</section>
				<section>
					My fear was that I will have to code in a neural network from scratch using MATHS! <br><br>
					But that isn't the reality at all.
					<aside class="notes">
						You can easily come in and after some preprocesing shove in your data into a ML model <br><br>
						And due to the way people have built these modules you can swap one model for another almost instantly
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section style="text-align:center">
					<img src="images/xkcd.png">
					<aside class="notes">
						However, I think it is still important to understand what the package is doing and how the algorithm works to provide robust analysis. <br><br>
						And this is most likely the more difficult bit of being a Data Scientist and doign the DSA.

					<div style="text-align:center;background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5); color: #fff; padding: 20px; padding-bottom: 0px;">
						<p>Ultimately the DSA demystified ML learning to me, and once I saw predictions come out of the end my ML pipeline I was extremely excited. <br><br></p>

						It made me feel I could do it (not that the predictions were any good)

								Google is your friend. Always ask google when you're stuck. <br>
								 	If you don't get into the habit of googling it will be more difficult when mentors are not around<br>
								Stackoverflow is a great resource where people upvote good questions and good answers to these questions and filter out all the duplicate questions with less efficient answers. <br>
								Coursera has a few good ML courses. The staple is the stuff by Andrew NG. You will stumble onto it.<br>
								Udemy is a tricky one, they have tons of courses. Its paid, but they rack up the prices and then do sort of fake discounts. <br>
									I could recommend quite a few Deep learning ones from here. <br>
								Datacamp - paid with some free courses (basics). ONS has seats you can get, check if any of your departments would do something like this <br>
								Cheatsheets - really good quick references. I used to have a bunch on spark printed out and taped to the wall next to my desk. <br>
								pyCon/pyData - Really good videos from various events and conferences. Skill level varies, but I learned a lot about the more expert features.<br>
								Official Documentation - most famous packages will have tons of documentation with examples. Also things like python pandas has a mini-tutorial section <br>

							<blockquote>
								Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. <...> Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do. <br><br>

								This one is a little more on point, a little more condenced.
								So by now you're thinking where is he going with this?

						<section>
							Don't forget all that you learned in the DSA. <br><br>
							And remember all the challenges you had to face.

							If you had trouble with IT/Data it will also be a problem for someone else. <br><br>

							Think about how you can <span style="color:#FF4081">change</span> this.
							<aside class="notes">
								See if there are any quick wins.
								Things like:
								<ul>
									<li>Data formats - can the storage of data be better for future DS</li>
									<li>IT - could I use any packages I needed on the Department IT and will having them add value?</li>
									<li>Would my coleagues benefit from knowing Python R etc and how can I promote this.</li>
